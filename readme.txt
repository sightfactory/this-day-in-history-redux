This "On This Day Redux" plugin allows you to enter historic or future events and display them via the included widget and shortcodes.


== Description ==

This plugin allows you to enter and manage different kinds of events that you then display in via a widget or shortcodes.


== Installation ==

Installing is pretty easy takes only a minute or two.

1. Upload 'this-day-in-history-redux' directory to your '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.

3. On the 'Widgets' sub-menu of 'Appearance' you will find a new widget type called 'This Day In History'; alternatively use a shortcode in a post or page.

4. Add this widget, to your themes widget display areas, select a title and click Save.

5. Enter historic events via the new 'Historic Events' admin page.  These will be automatically displayed by the widget on the anniversary of the day that they occurred.

* show_type (0, 1) - 1 shows event types (default) and 0 does not.
* show_year (0, 1) - 1 shows the year of the event (default) and 0 does not.

* type - enter a type to show only events of that type. Shows all types by default.
